[Gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com) fork of the [Jenkins Build Graph View!](https://github.com/jenkinsci/buildgraph-view) plugin
 
 Our build graphs are quite big and by default do not fit onto single screen so we have to modify the origin plugin to 
 make it more compact(squeezed) by removing padding, making boxes smaller, wrapping build names, removing unnecessary 
 build information etc.
